# Project Overview

Welcome to the **PAT Project** repository.  This project revolves around three
complementary pillars designed to create a cohesive ecosystem for token economics,
intelligent web agents and high‑quality data exchange:

1. **PAT coin launch** – an ERC‑20 compatible token on **zkSync Era** that will
   power the ecosystem.  PAT has a total supply of **555,222,888 tokens** with
   the following allocation: 10% ICO, 10% Team (6‑12 month linear vesting),
   30% Ecosystem and 50% Treasury.  The token is classified as a **utility token**
   under **Wyoming (USA)** jurisdiction.

2. **AI browser for data ingestion** – an autonomous browser agent powered by
   **Qwen** that navigates websites, interacts with forms and extracts
   **web browsing intent signals**.  The agent creates data segments that feed
   into the marketplace.  Building such an agent involves defining its purpose,
   designing its architecture (decision logic, perception and action modules),
   choosing the right AI models, developing perception/action modules, training
   and testing, and deploying as a browser extension.

3. **Data performance marketplace** – a platform that allows data providers to
   monetize high‑quality datasets and data consumers to discover and purchase
   data.  Data is stored on **centralized cloud** infrastructure with on‑chain
   pricing and settlement via PAT tokens on zkSync Era.  The marketplace
   connects providers and consumers in a secure environment with quality metrics,
   governance and transparent pricing.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains Markdown documents for each pillar.  These documents
outline design goals, technical requirements, suggested tools and next steps.

- [`pat_coin_launch.md`](pat_coin_launch.md) – technical and strategic plan for
  the PAT coin (ERC‑20) launch, including tokenomics, smart contract
  implementation, compliance and marketing.
- [`ai_browser_ingestion.md`](ai_browser_ingestion.md) – architecture and
  implementation guide for building the AI‑powered browser agent used for
  ingesting web data.
- [`data_performance_marketplace.md`](data_performance_marketplace.md) – concept
  and design document for building a data performance marketplace, including
  guidelines for data quality, governance and platform features.
- [`whitepaper_outline.md`](whitepaper_outline.md) – investor‑ and builder‑grade
  outline for a comprehensive whitepaper, covering market architecture, token
  design, incentive mechanisms and the phased roadmap to build data markets.

### Priorities

The most immediate priority for this project is the PAT coin launch.  The
documentation in `pat_coin_launch.md` provides a high‑level roadmap and
technical details needed to begin development.

## Contributing

These documents are intended to serve as a foundation for a software‑developer
agent.  Each file outlines tasks, requirements and milestones for its
corresponding pillar.  Contributions should be made via issues and pull
requests.  As the project evolves, feel free to expand these documents,
add diagrams or code samples and update tasks accordingly.
